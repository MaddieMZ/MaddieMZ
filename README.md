- Hilo to whoever's reading this! The name's Madeline or Maddie for short ^^. You may also know me as JoseMZ/MaddieMZ.
At this point I'm safe to say that I'm a non binary individual who identifies with both genders, mostly oriented towards the female one though.
Additionally, I have no dysphoria or insecurities regarding my masculine name and voice. I'm feeling better than ever with it💜

- I consider myself to be a warm, compassionate and very phisically active person who's most of the time prioritizing other people's joy, as seeing them brings me joy as well :3
